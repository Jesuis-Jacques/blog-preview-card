## Overview

This project is mainly based on HTML and CSS to build a Blog preview card on a webpage.

## My process

- Firstly, I downloaded the required starting images and guides for the project.
- Then I initialised Git for version control.
- Created an HTML file to set the structure right
- Then i used CSS to style it
  - Went to get the link required to deploy the required font [figtree] on the webpage
  - Adjusted accordingly for the paragraphs using padding to look exactly like the design
- Finally, i made the webpage responsive to some chosen screen sizes without the use of media query.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Git & Github [forVersionControl]

### What I learned

I learnt even more practical ways to optimise and make the website responsive to different screen sizes from mobile to tabs to desktop view, without the use of media query. I learnt the use of viewport height and width having gained insight from a peer review from my last challenge solution

Some code snippets that I feel are noteworthy from this projects are:

```css
  min-height: 100vh;
  min-width: 100vw;
  max-width: 1440px;
```

### Continued development

I look forward to learning more on responsiveness and having my own personal full-stack developer website where people can get to know me as tho on a personal level.

## Acknowledgments

Standing on existing protocol, lol. If i don't give credit to Simon of superSimpleDev on his impact on how he has shaped my journey as a full-stack developer, i'd be an ingrate in the dev world. 
Working on this project entirely by myself is something really worth of noting(i know you must be thinking "oh come on, not even google?"), yes not even google and this is thanks to Simon of superSimpleDev, check him out @ youTube.com/supersimpleDev.com and thank me later.

I'd also like to thank @Mikdra1 for his/her peer review, gave me insights on how to find other ways to make the webpage responsive to different screen sizes without the use of media query.
